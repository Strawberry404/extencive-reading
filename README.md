# extencive-reading

sometimes we need to go through dozens of articles and pdfs 

it can take from minutes to hours 

and all of that just causes eye strain and headaches

that why developers use dark theme ( except some people who loves taurturing their eyes) 


here's some usefull extentions and websites :

extension to switch websites into dark mode

switch pdfs into whatever background and text color you like (it may effect pictures within the pdf ):

cons: they limit pages into 30 pages max that why there's this :
